 * Service worker — makes the comparator installable and usable offline.
 *
 * WHY OFFLINE IS THE POINT, not a bonus. The place you most want to check a
 * supplement's score is standing in front of the shelf, and that is exactly
 * where a phone has no signal: pharmacy basements, supermarket aisles, Biocoop
 * back rooms. A comparator that needs the network is a comparator you consult
 * after you have already bought the wrong thing. The whole catalogue is ~390 KB,
 * so all of it fits in the cache and the app works with the radio off.
 *
 * PRIVACY. This worker talks to nothing but our own origin, stores no user data,
 * and sends nothing anywhere. Cross-origin requests (the analytics counter) are
 * not intercepted at all -- they fall through untouched, so this file can never
 * become a way to observe a visitor. /terms/ §8 promises the profile never
 * leaves the browser; a service worker is precisely the thing that could quietly
 * break that promise, so it does not get the chance.
 *
 * STRATEGY, and why each half is what it is:
 *   navigations  network-first. A stale HTML shell would pin an old app forever;
 *                falling back to cache only when the network actually fails
 *                keeps updates immediate and offline still working.
 *   assets       stale-while-revalidate. Instant paint from cache, refreshed in
 *                the background, so data.js is never more than one visit stale.

// Assets are requested with a cache-busting query -- `i18n.js?v=1.5`,
// `data.js?v=1.5` -- while the precache stores them under their bare path. A
// default caches.match() compares the full URL including the search string, so
// every one of those lookups missed and the app opened offline with an empty
// catalogue: the shell rendered, zero products. Matching with ignoreSearch is
// the fix, and it is safe here because nothing on this site varies by query
// string; the `?v=` exists only to bust the HTTP cache on deploy.

// under the request URL *with* its query (`data.js?v=1.5`) while the precache
// held the bare path; caches.match(…, ignoreSearch) then kept returning the
// older bare entry, so a fresh data.js was fetched on every visit and never
// served. Keying every put and match on the bare path means the revalidated
// copy replaces the stale one instead of sitting next to it.
