 * Cookieless audience measurement — guidelines §7.2, decided together with §6.2.
 *
 * WHY NOT GA4. §7.2 asked for GA4 so a baseline exists from zero. The problem is
 * that GA4 in the EU needs a consent banner, and a banner destroys the very
 * thing the baseline is for: with typical EU decline rates you measure a
 * self-selected 40-70% of traffic and never know which. A cookieless counter
 * needs no banner and counts everyone, so the baseline is actually a baseline.
 * It also keeps §6.2 (can we store anonymised profile data?) from blocking the
 * analytics install — there is no personal data here to have a question about.
 *
 * WHAT THIS DOES NOT DO, by construction:
 *   - no cookies, no localStorage, no sessionStorage, no device identifier
 *   - no cross-site or cross-session profile, no fingerprinting
 *   - no personal data, no IP stored (the providers below hash-and-drop it)
 *   - nothing about the personalised profile form ever leaves the browser
 *
 * That list is also what /terms/ §8 promises visitors, so it is load-bearing:
 * changing this file can make that page untrue.
 *
 * ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * TO SWITCH IT ON: set PROVIDER and SITE_ID below. Until then this file makes
 * no network request at all — it is deliberately inert rather than pointing at
 * a placeholder endpoint and 404-ing on every page view.
 *
 *   plausible   SITE_ID = "kleerer.com"     EU-hosted (plausible.io) or self-hosted.
 *   umami       SITE_ID = "<uuid>"          EU cloud or self-hosted.
 *   goatcounter SITE_ID = "<code>"          "<code>.goatcounter.com", free for
 *                                           non-commercial use, EU (NL) hosted.
 * Self-hosting: set HOST to your own origin; nothing else changes.
