    <h2>How the Health &amp; Compo Score works</h2>
    <p>Every product is scored 0–100 by an <b>open</b> script using only the label and public proofs, never marketing claims. The <b>method is open</b> so it can be audited; the <b>dataset and its price/label history are not published</b> — that accumulating archive is kleerer's moat. <b>Price is never part of the health score.</b></p>
    <h4>🟥 Red card</h4>
    <p>A product containing a substance banned, withdrawn or restricted by <b>any</b> of EU-EFSA, US-FDA or WHO (titanium dioxide E171, industrial trans fat, BVO, potassium bromate, Red 3, propylparaben…) is forced to <b>0 / grade E</b> — a banned additive is a disqualification, not a deduction. Strictest-guideline-wins: if one body flags it, we flag it.</p>
    <h4>Composition &amp; efficacy — 40 pts</h4>
    <p><b>Form quality (20):</b> chelated magnesium beats oxide; rTG omega-3 beats ethyl esters; Creapure® beats undocumented monohydrate; strain-coded probiotics beat un-coded. <b>Effective dosing (20):</b> daily dose vs published effective ranges and EFSA reference values, with penalties for exceeding EU upper limits.</p>
    <h4>Purity &amp; additives — 30 pts</h4>
    <p>Start at 30, subtract per additive, <b>proportionate to the health evidence</b>: fully hydrogenated fat −25, undisclosed/proprietary blend −10, BHA/BHT −10, <b>added sugar −8</b>, then sweeteners tiered by evidence (see below), azo colours −3, polyols/carriers/emulsifiers/fillers/coatings −2 each. Natural sweeteners (stevia, monk fruit), carrier oils, capsule shells and natural flavours are neutral. An unrecognised ingredient is never guessed at: the product is <b>withheld from the site entirely</b> until a human rules on the string. A −2 &ldquo;provisional&rdquo; penalty would be a claim that the worst case is mild, which is exactly what we do not yet know.</p>
    <h4>Our position on sweeteners (evidence-based)</h4>
    <p>Regulators (EFSA, FDA, WHO/JECFA) uphold sweetener safety at their acceptable daily intakes. Large cohorts (NutriNet-Santé, &gt;100 000 adults) and lab studies report <i>signals</i> — not proven causation — for some. We apply mild, proportionate precaution: <b>Tier D</b> sucralose/erythritol/xylitol −6 (mechanistic/CV signal), <b>Tier C</b> aspartame/acesulfame-K −4 (cohort signal), <b>Tier B</b> saccharin/cyclamate −2, <b>Tier A</b> stevia/monk fruit 0. Crucially, <b>added sugar (−8) is penalised more than any sweetener</b>, because the evidence that sugar harms health is stronger. We do not claim "sweeteners cause cancer".</p>
    <h4>Transparency &amp; testing — 30 pts</h4>

    <h4>Price level &amp; value (separate from the health score)</h4>
    <p><b>€ / standard dose</b> per category (€/25 g protein, €/1000 IU D3, €/10 g collagen…) plus a <b>price level 1–5</b> — a within-category affordability band (1 = cheapest per dose, 5 = priciest). A "cheap" €19 fish oil can cost more per gram of EPA+DHA than a €50 one.</p>
    <h4>Personalised dosing (separate from the health score)</h4>
    <p>If you fill in the optional profile, every product's daily dose is checked against <b>your</b> target. We keep two questions strictly apart. <b>Is it in your effective band?</b> — a personalised range built from your weight, sex, age and activity. <b>Does it breach a legal limit?</b> — the EU/ANSES upper limit, which is identical for everyone. A dose <i>above your band but below every limit</i> is safe, just more than you need: it is never shown in red. Only a genuine upper-limit breach is.</p>
    <table><tr><th>✓ fits you</th><td>inside your personalised band</td></tr>
    <tr><th>↓ under-dosed for you</th><td>below the band — the label serving would not get you there</td></tr>
    <tr><th>↑ more than you need</th><td>above the band, within every regulatory limit — a cost question, not a safety one</td></tr>
    <tr><th>⚠ over the EU limit</th><td>breaches a statutory upper limit (vitamin D 4000 IU, zinc 25 mg, supplemental magnesium 250 mg, melatonin 1.9 mg…)</td></tr></table>
    <p><b>We only personalise what the evidence lets us.</b> Protein scales with body weight and activity (ISSN / Morton 2018, ESPEN past 65); magnesium with weight and sex (~6 mg/kg, capped at the ANSES PRI); vitamin D with age and BMI; zinc with sex and activity (EFSA PRI). But collagen trials dose in absolute grams, and probiotics are strain-specific and not dose-linear — so those bands are <b>the same for everyone, and the product says so</b> instead of inventing a personalised number. Multivitamins get no single target at all: 20+ nutrients each have their own, so we point you to the per-nutrient categories rather than pretend one number exists.</p>
    <p>Personalised dosing never touches the Health &amp; Compo Score — two people looking at the same product see the same grade. It is guidance for healthy adults and <b>not medical advice</b>.</p>
    <h4>My stack (beta) — combined doses, checked</h4>
    <p>Add any products to a stack and we sum what you would actually swallow per day, nutrient by nutrient — including <b>declared built-in actives</b> (an omega-3 carrying 800 IU of vitamin D counts toward your vitamin-D total). Every total is checked against the EU upper limits — that works <b>without</b> a profile — and against your personal bands with one. Two 300 mg magnesiums quietly total 600 mg against a 250 mg supplemental limit; nothing on the label warns you, the stack does.</p>
    <p><b>Honest boundary:</b> multivitamin labels aren't per-nutrient coded in our data yet, so a stack containing one shows its totals as <i>lower bounds</i> and says so, rather than guessing. Products whose name declares an extra active we haven't coded are flagged, not silently ignored — the same instinct as the unrecognised-ingredient rule, which withholds the product outright.</p>
    <h4>Provenance (separate axis, not in the health score)</h4>
    <p>We flag country of manufacture (🇫🇷 France · 🇪🇺 EU · 🌍 outside EU) and a small proximity malus (0/1/3) reflecting kleerer's French focus. It is shown <b>separately</b>: a clean German product is not "less healthy" than a French one.</p>
    <h4>Language</h4>
    <p>The interface follows your browser's language preference (French or English) and you can switch it any time with the toggle in the header — your choice is remembered. We never look up your IP to guess: that would mean sending your address to a third party, and it would answer the wrong question anyway. Note that product-level editorial notes come from the label in the language they were published in.</p>
    <p>Full details, penalty tables, sources and limitations: <b>METHODOLOGY.md</b> in the repository.</p>`,

    <h2>About kleerer.</h2>
    <p><b>kleerer.</b> makes health data available to individuals seeking advice or recommendations. The project open-sources science-based resources and technologies to help people enhance their well-being — this comparator (p1) is the first product of that roadmap.</p>
    <h4>Why it exists</h4>
    <p>Supplement marketing sells stories; labels tell the truth. kleerer. reads the label for you: what form the active is in, whether the dose is effective, what else is in the capsule, and what the brand actually proves with third-party tests — then prices the product per gram of active, not per kilo of powder.</p>
    <h4>Independence</h4>
    <p>No sponsors, no affiliate links, no paid placements. Covers ${META.n_products} EU/FR products across ${META.n_categories} categories (snapshot ${META.snapshot}). The <b>scoring method</b> — script and rules — is open-source (MIT) so it can be audited and challenged; the <b>dataset and its daily price/label history</b> stay private, because that accumulating archive is what makes kleerer hard to replicate. If a brand disagrees with a score, the fix is the same for everyone: publish better proof.</p>
    <h4>Roadmap</h4>
    <p>p1: this comparator, with a personalised dosing check on every product. p2, <b>stack</b>, ships inside it (beta): build a basket across categories and it sums the combined daily doses — built-in actives included — warning when two products quietly push a nutrient over its EU limit, and showing what your profile's targets leave uncovered. Next: per-nutrient coding of multivitamin labels (so stack totals stop being lower bounds), the automated price &amp; label pipeline (source audit is Phase 1), and broader categories.</p>
    <p>The daily price-and-label archive stays <b>private</b>, and deliberately so — it is the asset, and publishing it would hand a scraper the one thing that took years to accumulate. What the site shows is today's catalogue; the history stays behind the wall.</p>
    <p style="margin-top:14px"><b>Not medical advice.</b> Always consult a healthcare professional before supplementing.</p>`

    <h2>Comment fonctionne le Health &amp; Compo Score</h2>
    <p>Chaque produit est noté de 0 à 100 par un script <b>ouvert</b>, à partir de la seule étiquette et des preuves publiques, jamais des allégations marketing. La <b>méthode est ouverte</b> pour pouvoir être auditée ; le <b>jeu de données et son historique de prix et d'étiquettes ne sont pas publiés</b> — cette archive qui s'accumule est la barrière à l'entrée de kleerer. <b>Le prix n'entre jamais dans le score santé.</b></p>
    <h4>🟥 Carton rouge</h4>
    <p>Un produit contenant une substance interdite, retirée ou restreinte par <b>l'une quelconque</b> des autorités UE-EFSA, US-FDA ou OMS (dioxyde de titane E171, graisses trans industrielles, BVO, bromate de potassium, Rouge 3, propylparabène…) est ramené à <b>0 / note E</b> — un additif interdit est une disqualification, pas une déduction. La règle la plus stricte l'emporte : si une seule autorité le signale, nous le signalons.</p>
    <h4>Composition &amp; efficacité — 40 pts</h4>
    <p><b>Qualité de la forme (20) :</b> le magnésium chélaté l'emporte sur l'oxyde ; l'oméga-3 rTG sur les esters éthyliques ; la Creapure® sur un monohydrate non documenté ; les probiotiques à souche identifiée sur les autres. <b>Dosage efficace (20) :</b> dose journalière face aux fourchettes efficaces publiées et aux valeurs de référence EFSA, avec pénalités en cas de dépassement des limites hautes européennes.</p>
    <h4>Pureté &amp; additifs — 30 pts</h4>
    <p>On part de 30, on retranche par additif, <b>proportionnellement au niveau de preuve sanitaire</b> : graisse entièrement hydrogénée −25, mélange propriétaire non détaillé −10, BHA/BHT −10, <b>sucre ajouté −8</b>, puis les édulcorants par paliers de preuve (voir ci-dessous), colorants azoïques −3, polyols/supports/émulsifiants/charges/enrobages −2 chacun. Les édulcorants naturels (stévia, fruit du moine), huiles support, enveloppes de gélules et arômes naturels sont neutres. Un ingrédient non reconnu ne fait jamais l'objet d'une supposition : le produit est <b>entièrement retiré du site</b> jusqu'à ce qu'un humain tranche. Une pénalité &laquo;&nbsp;provisoire&nbsp;&raquo; de −2 reviendrait à affirmer que le pire cas est bénin — précisément ce que l'on ignore encore.</p>
    <h4>Notre position sur les édulcorants (fondée sur les preuves)</h4>
    <p>Les autorités (EFSA, FDA, OMS/JECFA) confirment l'innocuité des édulcorants à leurs doses journalières admissibles. De vastes cohortes (NutriNet-Santé, &gt; 100 000 adultes) et des études de laboratoire rapportent des <i>signaux</i> — non une causalité démontrée — pour certains d'entre eux. Nous appliquons une précaution légère et proportionnée : <b>palier D</b> sucralose/érythritol/xylitol −6 (signal mécanistique ou cardiovasculaire), <b>palier C</b> aspartame/acésulfame-K −4 (signal de cohorte), <b>palier B</b> saccharine/cyclamate −2, <b>palier A</b> stévia/fruit du moine 0. Surtout, <b>le sucre ajouté (−8) est plus pénalisé que n'importe quel édulcorant</b>, parce que les preuves de sa nocivité sont plus solides. Nous n'affirmons pas que « les édulcorants donnent le cancer ».</p>
    <h4>Transparence &amp; tests — 30 pts</h4>
    <table><tr><th>Analyses de lots / certificats publiés</th><td>+12</td></tr>
    <tr><th>Certification tierce reconnue (Informed Sport, Cologne List, IFOS, Sport Protect, AFNOR NF…)</th><td>+10</td></tr>
    <tr><th>Matière première de marque traçable (Creapure®, EPAX®, Peptan®…)</th><td>+4</td></tr>
    <tr><th>Étiquette entièrement quantifiée, sans mélange propriétaire</th><td>+4</td></tr></table>
    <h4>Notes</h4>
    <p><b>A</b> ≥ 80 · <b>B</b> 65–79 · <b>C</b> 50–64 · <b>D</b> 35–49 · <b>E</b> &lt; 35</p>
    <h4>Niveau de prix &amp; valeur (distincts du score santé)</h4>
    <p><b>€ / dose standard</b> par catégorie (€/25 g de protéines, €/1000 UI de D3, €/10 g de collagène…) plus un <b>niveau de prix de 1 à 5</b> — une bande d'accessibilité au sein de la catégorie (1 = le moins cher par dose, 5 = le plus cher). Une huile de poisson « pas chère » à 19 € peut revenir plus cher au gramme d'EPA+DHA qu'une autre à 50 €.</p>
    <h4>Dosage personnalisé (distinct du score santé)</h4>
    <p>Si vous renseignez le profil facultatif, la dose journalière de chaque produit est confrontée à <b>votre</b> cible. Nous gardons deux questions strictement séparées. <b>Est-ce dans votre fourchette utile ?</b> — une fourchette personnalisée construite à partir de votre poids, sexe, âge et activité. <b>Cela franchit-il une limite légale ?</b> — la limite haute UE/ANSES, identique pour tout le monde. Une dose <i>au-dessus de votre fourchette mais sous toutes les limites</i> est sans risque, simplement plus que nécessaire : elle n'est jamais affichée en rouge. Seul un vrai dépassement de limite haute l'est.</p>
    <table><tr><th>✓ vous convient</th><td>dans votre fourchette personnalisée</td></tr>
    <tr><th>↓ sous-dosé pour vous</th><td>sous la fourchette — la portion indiquée ne vous y amènerait pas</td></tr>
    <tr><th>↑ plus que nécessaire</th><td>au-dessus de la fourchette, dans toutes les limites réglementaires — une question de coût, pas de sécurité</td></tr>
    <tr><th>⚠ au-delà de la limite UE</th><td>franchit une limite haute réglementaire (vitamine D 4000 UI, zinc 25 mg, magnésium des compléments 250 mg, mélatonine 1,9 mg…)</td></tr></table>
    <p><b>Nous ne personnalisons que ce que les preuves permettent.</b> Les protéines s'ajustent au poids et à l'activité (ISSN / Morton 2018, ESPEN au-delà de 65 ans) ; le magnésium au poids et au sexe (~6 mg/kg, plafonné à la RNP ANSES) ; la vitamine D à l'âge et à l'IMC ; le zinc au sexe et à l'activité (RNP EFSA). Mais les essais sur le collagène dosent en grammes absolus, et les probiotiques dépendent de la souche sans linéarité de dose — ces fourchettes sont donc <b>les mêmes pour tout le monde, et le produit le dit</b> plutôt que d'inventer un chiffre personnalisé. Les multivitamines n'ont aucune cible unique : plus de 20 nutriments ont chacun la leur, nous vous renvoyons donc aux catégories par nutriment au lieu de faire croire qu'un seul chiffre existe.</p>
    <p>Le dosage personnalisé ne touche jamais au Health &amp; Compo Score — deux personnes regardant le même produit voient la même note. Il s'agit de recommandations pour adultes en bonne santé et <b>non d'un avis médical</b>.</p>
    <h4>Ma routine (bêta) — les doses cumulées, vérifiées</h4>
    <p>Ajoutez des produits à une routine et nous additionnons ce que vous avaleriez réellement chaque jour, nutriment par nutriment — y compris les <b>actifs intégrés déclarés</b> (un oméga-3 apportant 800 UI de vitamine D compte dans votre total de vitamine D). Chaque total est confronté aux limites hautes européennes — cela fonctionne <b>sans</b> profil — et à vos fourchettes personnelles si vous en avez un. Deux magnésiums à 300 mg totalisent discrètement 600 mg face à une limite de 250 mg pour les compléments ; rien sur l'étiquette ne vous prévient, la routine si.</p>
    <p><b>Limite assumée :</b> les étiquettes de multivitamines ne sont pas encore codées nutriment par nutriment dans nos données ; une routine qui en contient affiche donc ses totaux comme des <i>minorants</i>, et le dit, plutôt que de deviner. Les produits dont le nom déclare un actif supplémentaire non codé sont signalés, pas ignorés silencieusement — le même réflexe que la règle sur les ingrédients non reconnus, qui retire purement et simplement le produit.</p>
    <h4>Provenance (axe distinct, hors score santé)</h4>
    <p>Nous signalons le pays de fabrication (🇫🇷 France · 🇪🇺 UE · 🌍 hors UE) et un léger malus de proximité (0/1/3) reflétant l'ancrage français de kleerer. Il est affiché <b>séparément</b> : un produit allemand irréprochable n'est pas « moins sain » qu'un produit français.</p>
    <h4>Langue</h4>
    <p>L'interface suit la préférence linguistique de votre navigateur (français ou anglais) et vous pouvez en changer à tout moment avec le sélecteur dans l'en-tête — votre choix est mémorisé. Nous ne consultons jamais votre adresse IP pour deviner : cela reviendrait à transmettre votre adresse à un tiers, et répondrait de toute façon à la mauvaise question. À noter : les remarques éditoriales propres à chaque produit reprennent l'étiquette dans la langue où elle a été publiée.</p>

    <h2>À propos de kleerer.</h2>
    <p><b>kleerer.</b> rend les données de santé accessibles aux personnes en quête de conseils ou de recommandations. Le projet ouvre le code de ressources et de technologies fondées sur la science pour aider chacun à améliorer son bien-être — ce comparateur (p1) est le premier produit de cette feuille de route.</p>
    <h4>Pourquoi il existe</h4>
    <p>Le marketing des compléments vend des histoires ; les étiquettes disent la vérité. kleerer. lit l'étiquette pour vous : sous quelle forme se présente l'actif, si la dose est efficace, ce que contient d'autre la gélule, et ce que la marque prouve réellement par des tests tiers — puis chiffre le produit au gramme d'actif, et non au kilo de poudre.</p>
    <h4>Indépendance</h4>
    <p>Sans sponsors, sans liens affiliés, sans placements payants. Couvre ${META.n_products} produits UE/FR dans ${META.n_categories} catégories (relevé ${META.snapshot}). La <b>méthode de notation</b> — script et règles — est open source (MIT) pour pouvoir être auditée et contestée ; le <b>jeu de données et son historique quotidien de prix et d'étiquettes</b> restent privés, parce que cette archive qui s'accumule est ce qui rend kleerer difficile à répliquer. Si une marque conteste un score, le remède est le même pour tous : publier de meilleures preuves.</p>
    <h4>Feuille de route</h4>
    <p>p1 : ce comparateur, avec un contrôle de dosage personnalisé sur chaque produit. p2, <b>routine</b>, y est intégré (bêta) : composez un panier toutes catégories confondues et il additionne les doses journalières cumulées — actifs intégrés compris — en alertant lorsque deux produits poussent discrètement un nutriment au-delà de sa limite européenne, et en montrant ce que les cibles de votre profil laissent découvert. Ensuite : le codage nutriment par nutriment des étiquettes de multivitamines (pour que les totaux cessent d'être des minorants), le pipeline automatisé de prix et d'étiquettes (l'audit des sources constitue la phase 1) et l'élargissement des catégories.</p>
    <p>L'archive quotidienne des prix et des étiquettes reste <b>privée</b>, et c'est délibéré — c'est l'actif, et la publier reviendrait à offrir à un aspirateur de données la seule chose qui a demandé des années d'accumulation. Le site montre le catalogue du jour ; l'historique reste derrière le mur.</p>
    <p style="margin-top:14px"><b>Ne constitue pas un avis médical.</b> Consultez toujours un professionnel de santé avant toute supplémentation.</p>`
