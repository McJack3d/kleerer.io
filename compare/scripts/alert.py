kleerer. — owner alerts (guidelines §5.2, the "alert to the product owner" leg).

The loop is: flagged product -> ALERT -> manual review -> publish or withhold.
Withholding already happens without anyone being told, which is the safe
failure. This is the part that stops "safe" from quietly meaning "the catalogue
shrinks every week and nobody notices".

Channels, all best-effort — a dead channel must never fail a build or a
collection run:

  stdout       always. A banner that survives being read in a scrollback.
  log file     always. ~/Library/Logs/kleerer-review.log (override: KLEERER_LOG_DIR)
  desktop      macOS notification, when running on a Mac with a session.
  webhook      only if KLEERER_ALERT_WEBHOOK is set. OFF by default and
               deliberately so: it posts product names to a third party, and
               nothing here should start talking to the network because a
               default was left on.

There is no email channel. Adding one means a credential in the environment of a
daily cron job, for a message that lands on the same machine that generated it.
The desktop notification does that job without the secret.
