kleerer. — unrecognised-ingredient review ledger.

THE RULE THIS ENFORCES (guidelines §5.2):

    A product flagged for review is NEVER displayed on the site before manual
    review.

Before this module, an ingredient string the auto-tagger could not classify
produced an "unknown" tag worth a provisional -2 purity penalty, and the product
was published anyway with the unknown surfaced on its card. That is a guess
presented as a score. An unrecognised string is not a small penalty — it is an
absence of knowledge, and it could equally be an inert bulking agent or a
substance that should red-card the product to grade E. Publishing a B-grade for
something we cannot read is the one failure mode the whole method exists to
avoid.

So: unrecognised -> WITHHELD, not penalised. The product leaves the site until a
human has ruled on the string.

HOW A STRING GETS CLEARED

Every decision is recorded here, against the normalised ingredient string, with
who decided it and when. A decision is one of:

    neutral            benign; scores nothing, penalises nothing
    penalty:<tag>      a known additive class; scores as that tag would
    banned:<name>      red card; forces the product to 0 / grade E

Because decisions key on the normalised string, ruling on "aromes" once clears
every product carrying it. The ledger is append-only in spirit: correcting a
decision rewrites the entry but keeps the previous one in `superseded`, so the
audit trail of what was believed when survives. That trail is also evidence of
the "verifying" investment the database right depends on (§9).

USAGE

    python3 scripts/review.py --list                 # what is pending, and what it blocks
    python3 scripts/review.py --decide "aromes" --as neutral --note "flavouring, no dose"
    python3 scripts/review.py --decide "e471" --as penalty:lecithin
    python3 scripts/review.py --decide "kava" --as banned:kava_extract
    python3 scripts/review.py --suggest-rules        # decisions ripe for promotion into autotag.py
