"""
Headless renderer for JS-only shops (Shopify, headless DTC, Amazon).

Why: many product pages ship an almost-empty HTML shell and inject price and
label with JavaScript after load. The static fetcher reads the shell and finds
nothing. This module drives a real Chromium *without a window* (Playwright),
executes the page's JavaScript exactly like a normal browser, then hands the
final DOM to the same extractor.

Politeness is identical to the static path: robots.txt is checked and the
per-domain rate limit is honoured BEFORE any browser navigation. The rendered
HTML goes through the same on-disk cache.

Cost: free. GitHub Actions public repos get unlimited minutes, and Playwright
installs its own Chromium there (see .github/workflows/daily-pipeline.yml).

Graceful degradation: if Playwright isn't installed, render() reports
unavailable and run.py falls back to the static fetcher — which often still
works, because most Shopify shops embed schema.org JSON-LD server-side.
