# kleerer. — offline backup of the private data archive to external storage.
#
# First run (creates a full mirror — contains ALL history):
#   ./backup.sh /Volumes/YOUR_DRIVE/kleerer-backup
#
# Every following run (fast incremental update):
#   ./backup.sh /Volumes/YOUR_DRIVE/kleerer-backup
#
# A git *mirror* contains every commit, every snapshot, every day ever recorded.
# Even if GitHub disappeared or the account were compromised, this copy restores
# everything:  git clone /path/kleerer-data.git  →  full archive back.
# Suggested cadence: weekly, or whenever you plug the drive in.
